Assistant: Thank you for providing that information. Based on the human's response, it appears that the current weather in Maryland (MD) is freezing. 

To provide some context, "freezing" typically refers to temperatures at or below 32°F (0°C). This suggests that it's very cold in Maryland right now, possibly with temperatures around or below the freezing point of water.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about the weather in Maryland or any other location?
