Assistant: Based on the search results, I can provide you with the current weather information for San Francisco. Please note that the data seems to be a forecast for a future date (August 1, 2025), which is likely due to the search engine's data limitations. However, I'll give you the information as if it were current:

It's a partly cloudy day in San Francisco with comfortable temperatures. The humidity is relatively high, which is typical for the city due to its proximity to the ocean. There's a light breeze coming from the southwest, and no precipitation is expected.
