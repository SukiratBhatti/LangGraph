# LangGraph Demo

## Project Structure

- `main.py` - Main application with LangGraph setup and chatbot logic
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `graph.png` - Generated visual representation of the conversation flow

## Packaging Obsession:
This is my first time using LangGraph.

Iteration one: build a basic chatbot using LangGraph framework.
Soon: tools, memory, human in the loop, custom state, time travel?
